	abstract = {This chapter discusses the statics, kinetics, and dynamics of molten salt reactors in a simple model that allows analytical solutions. Due to this, and the introduction of some further limiting cases, the chapter offers substantial insight into and understanding of the physics and the neutronic behavior of molten salt systems with circulating fuel. After a discussion of the properties of the model and the limiting cases for the static equations, a treatment of space–time transients is introduced, and some limiting cases are solved explicitly. Thereafter the kinetic and dynamic response of the reactor is derived by calculating the space–frequency-dependent neutron fluctuations (neutron noise) induced by small stationary perturbations of the system parameters. The validity of the point kinetic approximation and the calculation of the point kinetic component of the noise are discussed. Finally, the neutron noise induced by various perturbations propagating with the circulating fuel is calculated and discussed.},

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) were conceived at the early stages of nuclear energy in view of the favourable features fostered by a liquid fuel. They were developed as graphite-moderated thorium-fuelled breeder reactors till the seventies, when studies on this reactor concept were mostly abandoned in favour of the liquid–metal fast breeder concepts. A decade ago, the MSRs were included among the six GEN-IV systems and a core optimization process allowing for the GEN-IV main objectives led toward a fast-spectrum MSR concept (MSFR – Molten Salt Fast Reactor). Albeit advantageous in terms of U-233 breeding and/or radio-active waste burning, the new concept lacks the notable know-how available for the thermal-spectrum MSR technology. The present paper preliminarily investigates the MSR dynamics, based on the conceptual MSFR design currently available. A primary objective is to benchmark two different models of the MSFR primary circuit, both of them including a detailed and fully-coupled (node-wise) representation of turbulent fuel-salt flow, neutron diffusion, and delayed-neutron precursor diffusion and convection. A good agreement is generally observed between the adopted models, though some discrepancies exist in the temperature-field, with ensuing mild impacts on the reactor dynamics. The performed analyses are also used for a preliminary characterization of the MSFR steady-state and accidental transient response. Some points of enhancement needed in the MSFR conceptual design are identified, mainly related to in-core velocity and temperature fields. The reactor response following major accidental transient initiators suggests a generally benign behaviour of this reactor concept.},

	abstract = {Backward-Facing Step (BFS) flow is one representative model for separation flows, which can be widely seen in aerodynamic flows (airfoil, spoiler, high attack angle process), engine flows, condensers, vehicles (cars, boat), heat transfer systems, and even the flow around buildings, etc. The flow separation after a simple stage will introduce separation bubble formation, evolution and re-attachment process, which is dependent on the BFS geometric design, the inlet and outlet conditions, turbulent intensity, as well as heat transfer conditions. In the past decades, it has been widely studied by various theoretical, experimental and numerical methods. Considering the importance of BFS flow in both theoretical and engineering aspects, this paper is focused on a review study of BFS flows from fundamental understandings to various experimental and numerical developments in a historical viewpoint. Basic models and the parameter-based after-step flow laws are summarized and categorized in this study. It is shown that the step size (duct expansion ratio) will define the basic re-circulation and re-attachment process, while the coupled effects of inflow parameters and the perturbation designs also help shape the flow behaviors after BFS. The review is also extended with model generalizations and the implications on system design, especially the heat transfer effects and the representative control designs are discussed in detail. Future trends and prospects in BFS studies are also included in this study.},
